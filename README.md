🏦SIMPLE BANK APPLICATION


This project is a basic replication of a banking application, designed with two main user panels: Customer and Admin.


🛠️ Technologies Used

Back-end: ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core

Interface: Vue.js

Database: MySQL


🚀 Key Features

User authentication and role-based access control

🔧 Architecture

Currently, the project is built with two parts:

• A Razor Pages-based web interface

• A basic API structure

In the near future, the architecture will evolve into a fully decoupled system, where:

• The back-end will be structured entirely as a RESTful API

• The front-end will be built using a modern JavaScript framework (such as React or Angular)
